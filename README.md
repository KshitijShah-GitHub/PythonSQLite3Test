# Python SQLite 3 Database Managing GUI
A Python program the runs a GUI built with Tkinter library to display and modify a database file with sqlite3. It creates a table 
to contain information about students, the GUI can add, remove and modify entries based on a primary key column for student id which
is generated on adition of record. This was made for a job interview and was a little rushed and the code is admittedly very messy and 
likely very inefficient, but a good learning tool to dive into working with databases and GUI for the first time.

## Bugs:
The add/remove/modify functions change database file correctly but don't refresh the GUI frame correctly on modification/removal.
